# Chapter 3: Rotational Motion and Dynamics

## 3.1 Introduction to Rotational Motion

Rotational motion describes the movement of objects around an axis. Unlike linear motion, where we use position, velocity, and acceleration, rotational motion uses angular position (θ), angular velocity (ω), and angular acceleration (α).

### Key Concepts

**Angular Displacement**: The change in angular position, measured in radians.

**Angular Velocity**: The rate of change of angular position. For a point on a rotating object, ω = Δθ/Δt.

**Angular Acceleration**: The rate of change of angular velocity, α = Δω/Δt.

## 3.2 Torque and Moment of Inertia

**Torque** (τ) is the rotational equivalent of force. It causes angular acceleration and is calculated as:

τ = r × F = rF sin(θ)

where r is the distance from the axis of rotation, F is the applied force, and θ is the angle between r and F.

**Moment of Inertia** (I) is the rotational equivalent of mass. It depends on both the mass distribution and the axis of rotation.

For a point mass: I = mr²
For a solid cylinder: I = (1/2)MR²
For a solid sphere: I = (2/5)MR²

### Common Mistake Alert

Students often confuse torque and moment. Torque is a force that causes rotation. Moment of inertia is a property of the object's mass distribution. They are related through Newton's second law for rotation:

τ = Iα

## 3.3 Rotational Kinetic Energy

An object rotating about an axis has rotational kinetic energy:

KE_rot = (1/2)Iω²

This is analogous to linear kinetic energy KE = (1/2)mv².

### Energy Conservation in Rotation

Total mechanical energy includes both translational and rotational components:

E_total = (1/2)mv² + (1/2)Iω² + mgh

## 3.4 Angular Momentum

Angular momentum (L) is the rotational analog of linear momentum:

L = Iω

**Conservation of Angular Momentum**: In the absence of external torques, angular momentum is conserved. This explains why ice skaters spin faster when they pull their arms in (reducing I, increasing ω).

## 3.5 Problem-Solving Strategy

1. Identify the axis of rotation
2. Calculate moment of inertia for the object
3. Determine all torques acting on the system
4. Apply τ_net = Iα
5. Use kinematics to solve for unknowns
6. Check units and reasonableness

### Common Errors to Avoid

- Forgetting to use radians (not degrees) for angular measurements
- Using the wrong moment of inertia formula for the object shape
- Not accounting for the perpendicular component of force when calculating torque
- Mixing up linear and angular quantities (v vs ω, a vs α)
