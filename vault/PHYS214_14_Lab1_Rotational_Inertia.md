# Lab 1: Measuring Rotational Inertia

## Objective

Determine the moment of inertia of various objects experimentally and compare with theoretical predictions.

## Equipment

- Rotational apparatus with photogate
- Set of cylindrical masses
- Solid disk
- Hollow cylinder
- Stopwatch
- Calipers

## Procedure

### Part A: Solid Disk

1. Measure the mass (M) and radius (R) of the solid disk using the balance and calipers
2. Mount the disk on the rotational apparatus
3. Apply a known torque by hanging a mass from a string wound around the disk
4. Measure the angular acceleration using the photogate
5. Calculate experimental moment of inertia: I_exp = τ/α
6. Compare with theoretical: I_theory = (1/2)MR²

### Part B: Hollow Cylinder

Repeat procedure for the hollow cylinder.
Theoretical formula: I = (1/2)M(R₁² + R₂²) where R₁ is inner radius, R₂ is outer radius.

## Safety Notes

- Ensure the apparatus is securely mounted before applying torque
- Keep fingers clear of rotating parts
- Use caution when handling masses

## Data Analysis

Calculate percent error between experimental and theoretical values:

% Error = |I_exp - I_theory| / I_theory × 100%

Typical sources of error:
- Friction in bearings
- Air resistance
- Mass of string not accounted for
- Measurement uncertainty in radius

## Questions

1. Why do we use angular acceleration instead of angular velocity to determine I?
2. How would friction affect your calculated value of I?
3. Which object should have the larger moment of inertia: a solid disk or a hollow cylinder of the same mass and outer radius? Why?
