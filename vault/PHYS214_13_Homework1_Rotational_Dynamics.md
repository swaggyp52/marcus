Due: Friday, 11:59 PM

## Problem 1: Torque Calculation

A wrench 0.30 m long is used to tighten a bolt. The force is applied at an angle of 60° to the wrench handle with a magnitude of 200 N.

a) Calculate the torque applied to the bolt.
b) What force would be required if applied perpendicular to the wrench?

## Problem 2: Moment of Inertia

A solid sphere of radius 0.15 m and mass 2.0 kg rotates about an axis through its center.

a) Calculate the moment of inertia.
b) If the sphere is rotating at 5.0 rad/s, what is its rotational kinetic energy?
c) How much work was required to bring it up to this angular velocity from rest?

## Problem 3: Angular Momentum Conservation

A figure skater spinning at 2.0 rev/s has a moment of inertia of 4.0 kg·m². She pulls her arms in, reducing her moment of inertia to 2.5 kg·m².

a) What is her new angular velocity?
b) How does her rotational kinetic energy change?
c) Where does this energy come from?

## Problem 4: Compound Motion

A solid cylinder of mass 5.0 kg and radius 0.10 m rolls without slipping down an incline of height 2.0 m.

a) Find the cylinder's velocity at the bottom.
b) What fraction of its kinetic energy is rotational?
c) Compare this to a solid sphere of the same mass and radius. Which reaches the bottom faster?
